```python
# Python CleanScraperBot Electron Production with Integrated GUI
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog
import asyncio
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import webview

class CleanScraperBot:
    def __init__(self, driver_path):
        self.driver_path = driver_path
        self.data = None

    def navigate(self, url):
        # Code for navigating to the URL using Selenium

    def scrape(self, css_selector):
        # Code for scraping data from the web page using BeautifulSoup

    def clean_data(self):
        # Code for cleaning and processing the scraped data

    def run(self):
        # Code for GUI integration using Electron and webview

        # Create a Tkinter window
        root = tk.Tk()
        root.withdraw()

        # Open a webview window
        webview.create_window("CleanScraperBot", "index.html", width=800, height=600)

        # Start the event loop
        webview.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = CleanScraperBot("/path/to/chromedriver")
    bot.run()
```

In this updated version, the CleanScraperBot class is integrated with the Electron GUI using the webview library. The GUI window is opened using `webview.create_window`, where "CleanScraperBot" is the window title and "index.html" is the HTML file representing the GUI design. 
                                              The window dimensions are set to a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels.

The event loop is started with `webview.start()`, which allows the GUI to be displayed and interacted with. Users can input the URL and CSS selector through the GUI, triggering the corresponding methods (`navigate` and `scrape`) for web page navigation and data scraping. 
                                              The scraped data can then be cleaned and processed using the `clean_data` method.

This updated version provides a seamless integration of the CleanScraperBot functionality into the Electron GUI, creating a powerful and user-friendly tool for web scraping and data analysis.
